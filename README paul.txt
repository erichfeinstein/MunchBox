Week 1:
I added all the getter and setter methods for the journal entry. I also created the journal itself to test with.

Week 2:
Tried to get pictures to work and be attached to specific entries. Changed "photo" to "photoID" with the idea that imageView can all these photos when necessary instead of storing them in the entry.
Also made it so the default title for an entry is the first tag, if one exists.
