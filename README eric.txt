Week of 2/25

2/28: Clicking New Entry opens camera, on confirming image, EditEntry activity starts

2/27: Separated ViewEntry and EditEntry activities. ViewEntry opens on selecting an entry from the list. Will need to send an int with Intent to open activity so that the proper entry is opened (something for later). EditEntry is opened when pressing the New Entry button (eventually the button will open a camera interface, and then go to EditEntry display once an image is taken)

2/26: Small UI adjustments (circular buttons, new, progress on New Entry screen/starting new activities)
